          I still remember that day like it was yesterday â€” when you opened the little gift box
          with the bracelet and earrings inside. The way your eyes sparkled, the way your smile
          lit up the whole momentâ€¦ <em>meri rooh tak ko sukoon mila tha.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          That was the first time in my life I had ever bought something for someone so special.
          And I realized â€” it wasnâ€™t about the gift itself, it was about <strong>you</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          From that day, my heart made a silent dua:
          <br />
          <em>
            Ya Allah, keep her in my life forever. Let me be the reason for her smile, again and again.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Aaj bhi, when I think of that moment, I feel the same butterflies â€” knowing that this
          journey of ours started with such a small gift, but such a big love. ðŸ’–
